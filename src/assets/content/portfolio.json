Instead of birds, my implementation used bees, but it all boils down to the same concept. The UI allows the user to modify different intensities for the different parts of behaviour. It also has been optimized by subdividing the space into buckets.",

The game part of it enables the user to walk around using a character that has to pick up several pieces of a key before a door is opened, allowing them to progress to the next stage.\nThe sandbox part of it gives the user the option to choose from several different algorithms to generate the maze with. \n",
